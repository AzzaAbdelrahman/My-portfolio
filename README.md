My first Portfolio

This is my first portfolio where I a created three sections



In the first section I inculded a piture of myself and a paragraph about me



The second section is a section of my potenial projects, there are five sections, to make this section look very look I added features such as, hovering for example.


And the last section is a section of my contact details, i added links, therefore you will be directed once you have clicked on the word


In order to create this portfolio I used the knowledge I gained thoughout last week.
